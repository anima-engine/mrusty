//! # mrusty. mruby safe bindings for Rust
//!
//! mrusty lets you:
//!
//! * run Ruby 1.9 files with a very restricted API (without having to install Ruby)
//! * reflect Rust `struct`s and `enum`s in mruby and run them
//!
//! It does all this in a safely neat way, while also bringing spec testing and a
//! REPL to the table.
